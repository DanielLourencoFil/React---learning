# Getting Started with React

This project is my very first using React.
It project was an exercise from the course "
React Front To Back 2022" by Brad Traversy.

I added some small extra details to te original project: after submition of feed back
(1) submit button disabled.
(2) input clean.
(3) rating back to default (10)

In general, my first impression is that React makes the life of the Developer way easier... but, strangely, it makes me feel something was missing (maybe this feeling has something to do with Me already being a bit comfortable with the mess that quickly a vanilla js project can become).
